# Tamil Translator Playwright Test

This repository contains Playwright test cases to verify the functionality of a translation web application hosted at `https://tamiltranslator.pythonanywhere.com/`. The tests cover basic login functionality and translation verification.

## Prerequisites

Before you run the tests, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (>= 14.x.x)
- Playwright (`@playwright/test`)

You can install Node.js from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:


2. Navigate into the project directory:



3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install Playwright and other dependencies needed to run the tests.

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npx playwright test
```

This will execute the Playwright tests for the Tamil translator web application.

### Test Cases

1. **Successful Login Test**
   - The test navigates to the login page, inputs the username, and logs in.
   - It checks whether the URL changes to the home page after login.

2. **Translation Test**
   - After a successful login, the test fills in a sample text, selects source and destination languages, and clicks the translate button.
   - The test verifies that the correct translation is displayed for the input text.

### Sample Test File

The sample Playwright test file (`example.spec.ts`) includes both the login and translation tests:

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('successful login', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://tamiltranslator.pythonanywhere.com/login');
  await page.fill('input[name="username"]', 'test55');
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');
  await expect(page).toHaveURL('https://tamiltranslator.pythonanywhere.com/');
  console.log('Login test passed!');
});

test('translation test', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.fill('textarea[name="text"]', 'After translating the text, clear the history...');
  await page.selectOption('select[name="src_lang"]', 'en');
  await page.selectOption('select[name="dest_lang"]', 'ta');
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');
  
  const translation = page.locator('#translatedText');
  await expect(translation).toHaveText('உரையை மொழிபெயர்த்த பிறகு...');
  console.log('Translation test passed!');
});
```

## Running in Debug Mode

To run the tests in debug mode, use:

```bash
npx playwright test --debug
```

This opens up a browser and shows the test steps being executed, which is useful for troubleshooting.
